## How to Add a Data Source to vMix for an Esports Dashboard


<Steps  >
### **Open vMix**:
   - Launch vMix on your system.

### **Access Data Sources**:
   - In the vMix interface, locate the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the bottom right corner.
   - Click **Settings**, then navigate to the **Data Sources** tab.

### **Add a New Data Source**:
   - In the Data Sources window, click the **Add** button.
   - Select **Web Browser** or **JSON** as the data source type, depending on your setup. (For this endpoint, **JSON** is typically used since the endpoint provides JSON data.)

### **Configure the Data Source**:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the data source (e.g., "Esports Dashboard").
   - **URL**: Input the endpoint URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/getfulljson?vmix`.
   - **Update Interval**: Set the refresh rate (e.g., 1-3 seconds would be the recommended time).
   - Ensure the **Enable** checkbox is selected to activate the data source.

### **Test the Connection**:
   - Click **OK** to save the data source.
   - Verify the data is being pulled correctly by checking the **Data Sources** panel in vMix. You should see the JSON data from the endpoint.

### **Link to Titles or Graphics**:
   - Open the title or graphic in vMix where you want to display the esports data (e.g., scores, player stats).
   - In the title editor, select the text field or element you want to link.
   - Use the **Data Source** dropdown to select your newly created "Esports Dashboard" data source.
   - Map specific JSON fields (e.g., `score`, `player_name`) to the corresponding text or graphic elements.

### **Preview and Adjust**:
   - Preview the title in vMix to ensure the data populates correctly.
   - Adjust formatting, positioning, or refresh rates as needed for smooth display during the esports event.

### **Save and Go Live**:
   - Save your vMix project.
   - Add the title to your vMix input and go live with your esports dashboard.
