## Understanding Input Boxes

Think of input boxes as forms you can fill out. Each box on this screen helps customize different parts of your broadcast. There are four main types:

### Types of Inputs:

1. **Text Inputs** üìù
   - These are simple text boxes for entering names or titles
   - Example: Type in caster names or the host's name

2. **Image Inputs** üñºÔ∏è
   - These inputs accept image files (like .png, .jpg, webp etc)
   - Use these to add logos or pictures to your broadcast

3. **Color Inputs** üé®
   - Click to open a color picker
   - Perfect for customizing background colors or text colors

4. **List Inputs** üìã
   - These are dropdown menus with pre-set choices
   - Example: Choosing social media platforms from a list

### Features:

- **Move Inputs Around** üîÑ
  - See the lock icon (üîí) at the bottom right of each box?
  - Click it to unlock and drag the input wherever you want!

- **Get Technical Info** ‚ÑπÔ∏è
  - Look for the info icon (‚ÑπÔ∏è) at the top left of each input
  - Click it to see technical details (useful for developers)

- **Delete Inputs** ‚ùå
  - Click the trash can icon (üóëÔ∏è) to remove an input box you don't need
  - **Note**: This action is permanent!

- **Resize Inputs** ‚ÜîÔ∏è
  - You can also resize inputs by dragging the bottom left corner of the input box (‚ÜôÔ∏è)

Everything you enter here will automatically update your broadcast overlay in real-time!
