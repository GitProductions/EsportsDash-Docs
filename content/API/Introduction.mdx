## Introduction

Welcome to the API documentation for Esports Dash! This API provides a simple and powerful way to manage window controls, team data, and application settings programmatically.

All endpoints are accessible via the base URL: **`http://localhost:8080/api`**. The API is organized into three main categories, each designed for a specific purpose:



### Getting Started
To use the API, send HTTP requests (primarily `GET` methods) to the endpoints listed in the sections below. Each endpoint is designed to be straightforward, with clear parameters and responses. For example:
- Toggle the main window: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/window/toggleWindow`
- Update a team score: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/team/setScore?team=1&score=5`

**Quick Test**: Since these are `GET` requests, you can easily test them directly in your browser! Just paste the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api/window/toggleWindow`) into your browser’s address bar and hit enter—assuming the Esports Dash app is running locally on port `8080`.
